Hello, I'm Ansh and I am a Junior studying Computer Science. As chair of SIGtricity, I guide the club's direction, focusing on providing members with meaningful, hands-on learning experiences. My role involves shaping workshops that combine hardware and software, allowing members to work with full systems and gain a well-rounded understanding of both.
