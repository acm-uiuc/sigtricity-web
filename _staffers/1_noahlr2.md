Hello, my name is Noah and I am a Junior in Computer Engineering. I founded this student organization to provide an enviroment where anyone regardless of skill level or major can learn more about electrical engineering. My goal is to let any student request a topic they want to learn more about, and create a project or topic review to explain said topic.
