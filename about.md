## About Us

SIGtricity aims to give any student, regardless of experience level or major, exposure to the field of electrical engineering. We aim to do so by hosting topic reviews, workshops, projects, and other events, open to any student. No former knowledge is required for anything we host. We aim to be beginner friendly and accept members from all different ages, majors, and experience levels. If there is a topic you are passionate about or a topic you want to learn about, feel free to bring up your ideas to someone apart of our leadership team. We encourage members to become involved and even lead their own events if they wish. 

## Topic Reviews

Topic reviews are interactive sessions that aim to provide a broad overview of a suggested topic. These reviews will be in a format that is easily digestible for students to understand to cater to all different levels of understanding or experience. Topic reviews will be interactive, and not just sitting in a room listening to someone talking. (We don't want more lectures!) Some examples of interaction may be Kahoot, a demo, a game, or potentially even trips.

## Workshops

Workshops serve to give members a physical or digital project they can call their own. There is a gap in electrical and computer engineering where everyone wants a project, but not many know where to start. We aim to bridge that gap by providing members the materials and resources they need to create something. By the end of these workshops, we will ensure everyone is able to understand what they made at a high enough level where they can put a project on their resume and talk about it.

## Projects (Start TBD)

Projects are for our more dedicated members who are willing to consistently work on a larger project. These larger projects will be more complicated and open ended, however they will also be more fun. We are currently open to suggestions for semester-long projects. Feel free to suggest a project in our discord, or message someone on the leadership team.
